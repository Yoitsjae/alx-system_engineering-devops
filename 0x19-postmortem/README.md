##Postmortem: Web Server Outage

>Issue Summary:

Duration: June 25, 2023, 10:00 AM - June 25, 2023, 12:30 PM (UTC)
Impact: The outage affected the primary web server, resulting in a complete service disruption. Users experienced connection timeouts and inability to access the website, affecting approximately 80% of the user base.
Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the web server's virtual host settings, leading to a conflict in request routing and subsequent server overload.

>Timeline:

Detection: June 25, 2023, 10:05 AM (UTC) - An automated monitoring alert flagged an unusually high number of HTTP 500 errors.
Actions Taken:
Investigated server logs to identify patterns in error responses.
Assumed a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden influx of error requests.
Misleading Paths:
Explored the possibility of database issues, leading to unnecessary downtime for database maintenance.
Considered a code-level error, resulting in a temporary rollback of recent code changes.
Escalation:
Incident escalated to the DevOps team as the cause remained unclear.
Collaboration initiated with the Network team to assess potential network-related issues.
Resolution:
Identified misconfiguration in the virtual host settings, causing request conflicts.
Virtual host configurations reviewed and corrected to ensure proper request routing and load distribution.
Root Cause and Resolution:

>Root Cause Explanation:
Misconfiguration in virtual host settings led to request conflicts, resulting in server overload and subsequent service disruption.
Resolution Details:
Virtual host configurations adjusted to ensure clear request routing and load balancing.
Server capacity monitored closely to prevent similar overload scenarios in the future.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

>Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance monitoring to provide early warnings of unusual request patterns.
Implement automatic scaling based on real-time traffic to handle sudden spikes in server load.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of virtual host configurations to identify and rectify potential conflicts.
